# Caesar Cipher

A Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. This interactive command-line tool allows you to encode and decode messages using a shift-based substitution cipher.

## Features

- 🔐 **Encode messages**: Encrypt text using a customizable shift amount
- 🔓 **Decode messages**: Decrypt previously encoded text
- 🔄 **Interactive loop**: Continue encoding/decoding multiple messages without restarting
- 🎨 **ASCII art logo**: Beautiful visual display shown at the start of each operation
- 📝 **Preserves non-alphabetic characters**: Spaces, numbers, and special characters remain unchanged
- 🔁 **Continuous operation**: Logo and prompts refresh for each new encoding/decoding task

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. For example, with a shift of 3:
- 'a' becomes 'd'
- 'b' becomes 'e'
- 'z' wraps around to 'c'

The program handles both encoding (shifting forward) and decoding (shifting backward) operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Caesar-Cipher
```

2. No additional dependencies required - uses only Python standard library!

## Usage

Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

The program will display the logo and prompt you for:
1. **Direction**: Type `encode` to encrypt or `decode` to decrypt
2. **Message**: Enter the text you want to encode/decode
3. **Shift number**: Enter the number of positions to shift (must be the same shift used for encoding when decoding)

After processing, you can choose to continue with another message (the logo will be displayed again) or exit by typing `no`.

## Example

```
[ASCII art logo displayed]

Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello world
Type the shift number:
3
Here is the encoded result: khoor zruog

Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise type 'no'.
yes

[ASCII art logo displayed again]

Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
decode
Type your message:
khoor zruog
Type the shift number:
3
Here is the decoded result: hello world

Type 'yes' if you want to go again. Otherwise type 'no'.
no
Goodbye!
```

## Notes

- The program converts all input to lowercase for processing
- Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, numbers, punctuation) are preserved as-is
- The shift amount wraps around the alphabet (e.g., shift of 26 is equivalent to shift of 0)
